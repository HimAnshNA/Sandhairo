Sandhairo – E-Commerce Platform (MERN Stack)

Sandhairo is a modern e-commerce platform built using the MERN stack, offering essential online shopping features such as product browsing, authentication, cart management, and order workflows. It is designed with clean components, modular backend routes, and a scalable architecture suitable for real-world applications.

⚠️ Note: A Coming Soon page is currently live as I’m updating UI components, improving the backend structure, and refining a few workflows.
The project is fully functional; updates are enhancements, not a rebuild.
